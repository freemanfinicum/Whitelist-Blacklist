Welcome Everyone to the Whitelist-Blacklist Crypto Accounts Public Website Mission Statement!

This public resource website is developed to document and stand as repository to blockchain based token crypto currencies and or fiat currencies and their status includging any governmental acknowledge judgements.  This repository also stands as source for all Fraud related activities documented both crypto and non-crypto based online and offline as recorded publically and otherwise in and via any governmental acknowledged institution.  
The development of a public crypto currencies based repository is a healthy development and can discourage Fraud in all its manifestations.  If there is a secure public repository of information available in real time, Fraud and attempted Fraud may be discouraged. 
I invite everyone at this moment in time to take full responsibility for their affairs and financial affairs in particular.  Everyone can develop financial sovereignty and independence in their life using crypto-currencies and various asset exchanges. I find that using a couple of accounts at different exchanges works best for me, I can learn the different trading functions and practice completing "deposits" and "withdrawals" of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto-currencies.
